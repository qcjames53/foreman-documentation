== Headline Features

=== Entitlement Mode Removed in Favor of Simple Content Access
Simple Content Access (SCA) is now the only content access mode supported.
When upgrading Katello, all existing organizations that use entitlement mode will migrate automatically to SCA.
This change is not reversible.

Toggling SCA from the Organization Edit page, the Organization Create page, and the Organization List page is no longer available.

=== Removed System Purpose-Related Host Statuses
The following host statuses are removed:

* Subscription Status (this column has also been removed from the All Hosts table)
* System Purpose Status
* SLA Status
* Role Status
* Usage Status
* Addon Status

=== Debian Content Support Expanded
Import and export are now supported for repositories containing debian-type content.
Additionally, the host details page will now display more details for debian packages.

[id="katello-upgrade-warnings"]
== Upgrade Warnings

Simple Content Access (SCA) is now the only supported content access mode.
Existing organizations will be automatically migrated on Katello upgrade (see more info above).
Please note that the 'Subscription - Entitlements' report template does not work with SCA organizations and will never have any rows.
It will be removed in a future release or release candidate.
Instead, use the 'Host - Installed Products' report.
Additionally, please note that SCA-related API and Hammer endpoints and parameters have not yet been removed so you will experience errors if you try to use them.
They will be removed in a future release or release candidate.

Certain host statuses have been removed (see more info above).
Please note that system purpose _attributes_ are not being removed, only system purpose-related _host statuses_.
System purpose _attributes_ (role, usage, release version, etc.) are still important for repository enablement and reporting to the Subscriptions service of the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

[id="katello-deprecations"]
== Deprecations

Deprecated 'Subscription - Entitlements' report template as it does not work with SCA organizations.

Deprecated certain SCA-related API and Hammer endpoints and parameters.
These are likely non-functional and will be removed in the future.
